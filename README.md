## Tasks
[] create fakeService() function in fakeService.js to mock fetching data (return a promise)
[] implement fakeService() inside of BasicSetup (index.js) to fetch the data when the component initializes.
[] using every entry of the fetched data, solve every one by finding the permutations as described below.
[] render the fetched data from the BasicSetup component
[] Use the `permutation-component` component inside of BasicSetup to display the contents of each item/person from fakeService.


## Permutations of string

Given two strings s1 and s2, find the substrings of s2 that are permutation of s1, or nothing otherwise.
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
